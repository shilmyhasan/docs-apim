# Viewing API Statistics

API statistics related to both the API Publisher and the Developer Portal can be viewed using the **dashboard** runtime of the API-M Analytics server.

For instructions on how to set up Analytics, see [Configuring APIM Analytics]({{base_path}}/learn/analytics/configuring-apim-analytics). 
Once Analytics is set up, follow the instructions below to view statistics relevant to API Publisher and Developer Portal.

First, [invoke a few APIs]({{base_path}}/learn/consume-api/invoke-apis/invoke-apis-using-tools/invoke-an-api-using-the-integrated-api-console) to generate traffic and see the statistics.

!!! note
      The following widgets on the API Manager statistical dashboards, display real runtime statistics even when Analytics is not set up (as described in [Configuring APIM Analytics]({{base_path}}/learn/analytics/configuring-apim-analytics)).

!!! warning
      Please note that our data summarization logic summarizes the data on a **per day** basis.


The sections below explain how to access the statistical dashboards:

+ Log in to the Analytics Dashboard by accessing `<Protocol>://<Host>:<Port>/analytics-dashboard` (ex: [https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard](https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard)).Â 
+ After login in, you will see the **APIM Publisher**, **APIM Developer Portal** and the **APIM Admin** dashboards listed.
  
       [![Analytics Dashboards]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/analytics-dashboard-listing.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/analytics-dashboard-listing.png)

+ Click on the card of any desired dashboard to view that particular dashboard.
+ By using APIM Admin dashboard, administrators can generate a monthly API usage report. For more
 information see [Monthly API Usage Report]({{base_path}}/learn/analytics/monthly-api-usage-report).
+ Admin Portal Statistics can be viewed from the admin app.

     alt="failover" width="80%" height="80%"/>
</body>
</html>

### Faults

#### Top Faulty APIs

A successful invocation is when an API receives the expected response. 
In Analytics, if a runtime exception that is related to the backend communication occurs, it is considered as a faulty invocation. 
However, authentication related issues are not considered as faulty invocations. 
A percentage of faulty invocations for each API is displayed in this widget and it also has a list view which displays the total number of faulty invocations for each API.

<html>
<body>
<img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/publisher-fault-top-faulty-apis.png"

     alt="failover" width="60%" height="60%"/>
</body>
</html>

### Geo Map

#### Geo Location Based Invocations

Geolocation based statistics are used to carryout detailed monitoring of geographic locations. 
You need to pass an x-forwarded-for header with the relevant IP in the API request in order to generate Geolocation based statistics. 
For more information, see [Using Geolocation Based Statistics]({{base_path}}/learn/analytics/analyzing-apim-statistics-with-batch-analytics/using-geo-location-based-statistics/configuring-geolocation-based-statistics/). 

The data script that updates statistics related to geo locations is executed once a day. 
Therefore, at a given time, some statistics generated within the last 24 hours may not be displayed in this widget.

<html>
<body>
<img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/publisher-geo-map-geo-based-invocation.png"

## Developer Portal Statistics

!!! info
      Similar to the Publisher statistics dashboard, Developer Portal statistics dashboard can be viewed by any user having Analytics role or subscriber role. 
      And these permissions can be changed as per your preferences by going to **Settings** options of the dashboard. More information can be found at [Managing Analytics Dashboard Permissions]({{base_path}}/learn/analytics/managing-dashboard-permissions/) page.


Log into the analytics-dashboard application and access developer portal statistics (ex: [https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard/dashboards/apimdevportal](https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard/dashboards/apimdevportal)) dashboard from there.

#### Faulty Invocation per Application

In a faulty API invocation, the message is mediated though the fault sequence. 
By default, the API Manager considers an API invocation to be faulty when the backend service is unavailable or if a runtime exception occurs that is related to the backend communication.
The total number of invocations made by each application that are faulty are represented in these statistics.

<html>
<body>
<img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/devportal-faulty-invocations-per-application.png"

<tr class="odd">
<td>Status</td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>This indicates the status of the API. There are two possible values; <strong>Available</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Available</strong> - This status indicates that the API has traffic with normal successful invocations. By default, if an API receives successful invocations for at least one out of five invocations within 30000 milliseconds, the status of the API becomes <strong>Available</strong>.</p>

<html><div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

The availability of APIs statistics is directly related to the [Availability of APIs (health monitoring)]({{base_path}}/learn/analytics/managing-alerts-with-real-time-analytics/alert-types/#availability-of-apis-api-health-monitoring) alert type.

## Date Range Picker

This can be used to configure the **time period** and **granularity mode** of the data which should be visualized in the widgets listed above.

The following diagram shows the configurable options in this widget.  

<html>
<body>
<img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/publisher-date-time-picker.png" width="500"/>
</body>
</html>

The time period can be defined, either choosing from `Quick Ranges` or defining `Custom Ranges`. For the quick ranges `1 Min`, `15 Min`, `1 Hour`, `1 Day`, `7 Days`, `1 Month`, `3 Months`, `6 Months`, and `1 Year` options are provided.
For `Custom Ranges` users can define the start date as `From` and end date as `To`.

For `Quick Ranges` the **granularity mode** selected as default and for `Custom Ranges`, users can choose from `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `month` and `year`.

Generally, the widgets will visualize the data retrieved during the initialization. But if the users are required to update the widget with new data since the widget's initial load, they can toggle the `sync button`
(
<html>
<body>
<img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/analytics-sync-button.png" width="20"/>
</body>
</html> 
) marked at the upper right corner of the diagram.

!!! note
        During the `synced mode` the `To` value of the Date Range Picker will be updated to the current timestamp every 30 seconds and all the widgets will retrieve the data for the updated time period. This mode can be useful to present the dashboard in a non-interactive display.
