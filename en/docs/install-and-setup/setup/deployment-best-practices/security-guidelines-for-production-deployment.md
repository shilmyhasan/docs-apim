# Security Guidelines for Production Deployment

Given below are the common security guidelines for deploying a WSO2 product in a **production environment.**

Also, see the [production deployment guidelines]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/deploying-wso2-api-manager/production-deployment-guidelines/#production-deployment
-guidelines) and any other product-specific guidelines that might come in the respective product's documentation.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Apply security updates</p></td>
<td><p>Apply all the security patches relevant to your product version. WSO2 API manager is supported by 
WSO2 Update Manager (WUM) to get updates, since the version of API-M 2.1.0. Hence you need to use WUM to get the latest 
security patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions in <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/updates/Getting+Started">Getting Started with 
WUM</a> .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WSO2 releases security patch notifications monthly via the Support Portal. However, for highly 
critical issues, patches are issued immediately to customers.</li>
<li>WSO2 does not issue patches publicly for older product versions. Community users are encouraged to use the 
latest product version to receive all the security issues resolved until the particular product release.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Change default keystores</p></td>
<td><p>Change the default key stores and create new keys for all the cryptographic operations. WSO2 products by default come with a self-signed SSL key. Since these keys are public, it is recommended to configure your own keys for security purposes. Consider the following guidelines when creating the keystores:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select a key size of at least 2048 bits.</p></li>
<li><p>Use an SHA256 certificate.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that WSO2 default certificates do not exist in any of the keystores in your production environment. For example, be sure to delete the default public certificate in the default trust store that is shipped with the product.</p></li>

For example, the default HTTPS port is 9443 and the HTTP port is 9763. Also, Axis2 services are exposed over the following ports: 8243 and 8280.</p>
<p>To change a default port, update the <code>&lt;Offset&gt;</code> element in the <code>carbon.xml</code> file as

<code>sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"</code> under <code>[transport.https.sslHostConfig
.properties]</code> in <code>deployment.toml</code> file. And also configure strong ciphers for

<li>Also, consider the following factors when deciding on the ciphers:
<ul>
<li>DES/3DES are deprecated and should not be used.</li>
<li>MD5 should not be used, due to known collision attacks.</li>
<li>RC4 should not be used, due to crypto-analytical attacks.</li>
<li>DSS is limited to a small 1024 bit key size.</li>

<p>Note that (for WSO2 products based on Carbon 4.4.11 or later versions which implies API-M 2.1.0 and newer) HSTS is disabled for the applications with which the product is shipped by default.

<td>Session Data Cleanup</td>
<td>
<div style="background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;">
<p><strong>Note     :</strong> This security guideline is specific only to WSO2 Identity Server.</p>

<p>In a production environment, there is a possibility for a deadlock/database lock to occur when running a session 
data cleanup task in high load scenarios. To mitigate this, configure the following property to clean data in chunks.
 Configure this property in the <code>              &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/repository/conf/deployment.toml</code> file under
  <code>&lt;SessionDataCleanUp&gt;</code> with the required chunk size. This value is in the number of records and depends on the database type and server capacity. It also depends on the amount of load generated by single sign-on (SSO). A higher value increases the chances of deadlocks and a lower value increases the time it takes for a cleanup.</p>

<li>The &quot;/carbon&quot; context is used in WSO2 products to expose the management console (administration console) of the product. The management console is a user interface for performing some of the administrative operations of a product.</li>
