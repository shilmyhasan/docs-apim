# Product Profiles

When a WSO2 product starts, it starts all components, features and related artifacts bundled with it. Multi-profile support allows you to run the product on a selected profile so that only the features specific to that profile along with common features start up with the server.

!!! tip
    Starting a product on a preferred profile only blocks/allows the relevant OSGI bundles. As a result, even if you start the server on a profile such as the `api-devportal` for example, you can still access the API Publisher web application.

!!! OSGI Bundle
    OSGI bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any). In OSGi, a bundle is the primary deployment format. Bundles are applications that are packaged in JARs, and can be installed, started, stopped, updated, and removed.


## API-M Profiles

The following are the different profiles available in WSO2 API Manager.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Profile</th>
<th>Command Option with Profile Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Gateway worker</td>
<td><pre><code>-Dprofile=gateway-worker   </code></pre></td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>Only starts the components related to the API Gateway.</p>
<p>You use this when the API Gateway acts as a worker node in a cluster. This profile starts the backend features for data processing and communicates with the management node.</p>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Key Manager</td>
<td><pre><code>-Dprofile=api-key-manager</code></pre></td>

</div></td>

<tr class="odd">

<p><br />
</p>
</div></td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>Only starts the features relevant to the Traffic Manager component of the API Manager.</p>
<p>The Traffic Manager helps users to regulate API traffic, make APIs and applications available to consumers at different service levels, and secure APIs against security attacks. The Traffic Manager features a dynamic throttling engine to process throttling policies in real-time, including rate limiting of API requests.</p>

### Starting an API-M profile

You can start an API Manager profile in the following methods, based on your requirement

-   [Method 1 - Optimizing before starting the server](#method-1-optimizing-before-starting-the-server)
-   [Method 2 - Optimizing while starting the server](#method-2-optimizing-while-starting-the-server)

!!! note
    It is recommended to start the components in the following order: 

    1. Key Manager
    2. Publisher
    3. Developer Portal
    4. Traffic Manager
    5. Gateway
    
#### Method 1- Optimizing before starting the server

Create an optimized distribution for a particular API-M profile.

1.  Run the `<API-M_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.sh` script or `<API-M_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.bat` script based on your operating system, with the profile flag.

    ``` tab="Sample Format"
    sh <API-M_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.sh  -Dprofile=<preferred-profile>
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Linux/Solaris/MacOS"
    sh <API-M_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.sh  -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Windows"
    <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.bat -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```
    
2.  Start the server with the specified profile. 
    
    ``` tab="Sample Format"
    sh <API-M_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh -Dprofile=<preferred-profile>
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Linux/Solaris/MacOS"
    sh <API-M_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Windows"
    <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.bat -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```    
      
    
#### Method 2 - Optimizing while starting the server

1.  Start the server using the script based on your operating system, using the command given below.

    ``` tab="Sample Format"
    sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh --optimize -Dprofile=<preferred-profile>
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Linux/Solaris/MacOS"
    sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh --optimize -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Windows"
    <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.bat --optimize -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```

Configuration optimization is one step occurred in profile optimization process. This is occurred by replacing the 
deployment.toml file with a pre-configured profile-specific toml file existing in the pack. If 
required, we can skip this step from the profile optimization process, via passing additional option 
`--skipConfigOptimization`, so that the existing deployment.toml file in the pack will not be overridden. 
    
    ``` tab="Sample Format"
    sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh --optimize -Dprofile=<preferred-profile> --skipConfigOptimization
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Linux/Solaris/MacOS"
    sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh --optimize -Dprofile=api-publisher --skipConfigOptimization    
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Example:Windows"
    <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.bat --optimize -Dprofile=api-publisher --skipConfigOptimization
    
    ```  
        
So, before running this command (with `--skipConfigOptimization` option) you are expected to do the configuration 
changes in deployment.toml manually in the pack. So passing this option allows you to preserve the already manually
 applied configurations, when doing the profile optimization via the commands.

!!! note
    Doing the profile optimization using the scripts, is the recommended approach and manually doing 
    the optimization including the usage of option --skipConfigOptimization, should be done only in the cases 
    where it can't be avoided.
